# Validation Testing

## [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

Using the deployed Heroku app, each url was run though the W3C HTML Validator successfully. 

The following was corredcted:
In the iframe on the contact page I used percentages for width and height. I changed this and specified the height and width with numerical values to represent the pixel dimensions.

## [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

The CSS from the static file was directly input to the CSS Validator and no errors were found.

## [Python Validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

Pep8 CI was used to validate python code and the following errors were corrected:

- blank lines contain whitespace
- lines too long 
- need new lines at end of file

## [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/)
Lighthouse was used check on performance and accessibility. 
Overall the scores of the Performance,Accessibility and SEO were 100 and never lower than 95. 
The only low score was Best Practices with a score of 78. This is due to the "Uses third-party cookies" warning. 
Since it refers to the use of cookies set by third-party domains on my website and time ran out I didn't address this issue.

An example of the testing and the error:

# Bugs

## Bugs Outstanding
 At the moment when booking a table in the booking form it is possible to book a table in the past. 
 Since the contact details of guest are being requested when making a booking as for now the admin/ restaurant manager can contact the guest and inform them about the mistake. 
 Running out of time I didn't prioritize this issue but will fix it in the future.
